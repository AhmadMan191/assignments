For the assessment of this module you'll have to work on one kNN and one Naive Bayes (NB) problem and serve two roles: author and reviewer.

## Instructions

* Decide who will analyze the kNN and who the NB problem.
* During each block the analyst will author the notebook. The reviewer will assess the quality of the work and suggest improvements.
* At the end of the course each team participant will have authored one notebook and reviewed another one.

Open de `.Rmd` files in RStudio and follow the instructions. Make sure you document all the steps in your data mining proces properly.
